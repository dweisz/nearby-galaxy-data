Star Formation History data for Local Group Dwarf Galaxies from Weisz et al. 2014 (ApJ, 789, 147)

out.final has uncertainites that reflect random + systemstics due to stellar evolution uncertianites. 
these files should be used for most SFH analysis, as the systematics caputure SFH uncertaintites due to depth of CMD.

out.mcmc.final contains only the random component of the uncertainites and should be used seldomly 
(e.g., when doing differential SFH comparisions from CMDs of similar depths)

The columns in each of the SFH files are listed here.
(1) log(look back time) younger age
(2) log(lookback time) older age
(4) SFR (Msun /yr)
(5) upper uncertainty on SFR
(6) lower uncertainty on SFR
(7) mean metallicity ([M/H]) — note if SFR ==0 then this column is 0 (but that doesn’t mean solar!)
(8) upper error on mean metallicity
(9) lower error on mean metallicity
(10) metallicity dispersion
(11) upper error on metallicity dispersion
(12) lower error on metallicity dispersion
(13) cumulative SFH
(14) upper error on cSFH
(15) lower error on cSFH
